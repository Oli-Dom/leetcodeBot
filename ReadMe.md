# Discord LeetCode Bot

A Discord bot built with **Discord.js**, **Node.js**, and **Supabase** that helps users practice LeetCode questions. It queries a Supabase database to fetch three random questions based on each user's progress:

1. **One question they've solved** for review.
2. **One question they want to review** to solidify concepts.
3. **One question they haven't solved** to challenge them.

## Features

- **User-Specific Practice**: Tailored question recommendations based on progress and preferences.
- **Randomized Questions**: Every session provides fresh, unique questions.
- **Engagement via Discord**: Bot pings users directly on Discord, encouraging consistent practice.
